## What is TypeScript

> typescript is a superset of javascript theat means everything that you can do in js that is already available in typescript and a lot more is available to that but that is kind of true statement but not accurately contextualized by a lot of people.
 
> its not like adding more feature in javascript. it doesn't give you more callbacks , doesn't give you more arrow funtions . it's just allow you to write javascript in a much precise manner so that you code faces a lot less error in the runtime. if there is any error its already being displayed to you and you can fix it in the runtime (writing the code into the editor VS code).

> so it is not going to give you a new loop , new classes or new modules. infact all the code that you write in typescript is finally converted into javacript. (using the tsfile configuration at the production level or using tsc commond for converting the single file).

> typescript is not about reinventing the javascript . its all about just type safety nothing more.

> typescript is not a new programming language . its just a development tool. using this we can write js code in more precise manner and less error code . 

> typescript is all about static checking. static checker is checked our code at the time of writing and throw error if any error occured. if we are not using TS that time javacript code directy executed in browser or node environment and after that if any error he will throw error on your face and you need to rerun the code.

> so its just analyze the code as we type.
